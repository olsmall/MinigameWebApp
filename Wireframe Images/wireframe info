## Index Page

The home page will automatically display all the available games in a grid format. The user can use the navigation menu to search specific games or access their account. 
Upon a first visit to the site, the user will be asked to create a user account and log in. Users can choose to not create an account but their scores will not be saved and won't be added to the leaderboard. The user can click on the account icon to log in at any time. 
When the user clicks on a game, they will be taken to that game's page.

## Game Page

The game change will change format depending on the game selected. In the wireframe diagrams, the game page reflects the game Voltorb Flip. 
This game requires user controls on the right side of the page that allows the user to change how they are marking the squares in the center of the screen. They can mark the squares with either a bomb, 1 coin, 2 coins, or 3 coins. 
The left side of the page shows the user's current total score, or number of coins, and the current coins collected on the level they're on. 

## Data Passing

Upon creating a user account, the user's data will be added to the database. The database will record the games they've played with their associated high scores, an email, a user ID, the date the profile was created, and the user's account password. 
Clicking on a game creates a session for the game where the temporary score will be held until it's passed to the database if it's a high score.
