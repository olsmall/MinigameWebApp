# MinigameWebApp
This is a web app that recreates nostalgic minigames to play in browser.

## Introduction

Often, in video games, there are mini-games for the player to enjoy outside of their main quest. One instance of this concept is in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time which has a fishing mini-game. Players can sink hours into playing these mini-games and get very sidetracked from what they are doing. However, down the line after beating the game, I want to return to those mini-games. It can become a hassle to replay the game or backtrack across the map to the mini-game. In some cases, the user no longer has the console set up or readily available. I would love the convenience of opening my phone and playing a game for 10 minutes like I would a daily Wordle or crossword puzzle.

## Game 1: Voltorb Flip

In my specific case, I have the desire to play the mini-game Voltorb Flip from Pokemon Soul Silver. This mini-game is a mix between Minesweeper and Picross. The game is played in a 5 x 5 grid with numbers on the rows and columns denoting the number of coins and bombs. Each time the player successfully clears a board, the boards get harder. Upon failure, the player drops down to previous levels depending on how far they progressed in the board. For example, if they are on level 5 and almost complete the entire board before failing, they’ll drop to level 4. If they are on level 5 and fail immediately, they’ll drop to level 1.

## Game 2: Knucklebones

Another mini-game I commonly want to play is Knucklebones from the indie game Cult of the Lamb. Knucklebones is a dice-rolling game played against an AI opponent where the player and the opponent both have a 3 x 3 grid. Players take turns rolling dice and placing them in their grid.

## Design

Recreating these games would require a user interface, AI opponents, and a logic engine for both, and more. This website would be expandable as I could keep recreating beloved mini-games into a web-compatible form. I would have the main screen be a grid with screenshots of each game, and the subsequent game screens be inspired by the games they came from.

## Conclusion

Of my multiple ideas, I believe I would enjoy developing and having this site exist the most. The different types of games would have their own design challenges of their math and rules behind them.
